todo
- figure out why the screen blinks when i first press pause, but not subsequently
- delay timer should be related to emulation speed. (delay/sound sleep calculated as a fraction of global speed variable?)
	- or maybe, timers should just decrement once per loop...
- how do i implement sound? terminal ding?

backlog
- generalize GUI code to allow a different gui framework
- improve unit test coverage. test edge cases!
